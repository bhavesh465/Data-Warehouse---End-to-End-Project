Data Warehouse & Analytics Pipeline ‚öôÔ∏è
An end-to-end data pipeline that extracts operational technology (OT) data using Python, warehouses it in Snowflake, and visualizes key metrics using Power BI.

This project serves as a complete blueprint for building a modern data warehouse. It automates the process of fetching data from a source (the "OT Downloader"), loading it into a scalable cloud data warehouse, and creating interactive dashboards for business intelligence and analysis.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project follows a classic Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) architecture:

Extract: A Python script (downloader.py) is scheduled to run periodically. It fetches the latest data from the source OT system (e.g., an API, a database, or log files).

Load: The raw data is immediately loaded into a landing schema in Snowflake, ensuring minimal data loss and a preserved raw history.

Transform: SQL models are run within Snowflake to clean, transform, and aggregate the raw data into analytics-ready tables (e.g., fact and dimension tables).

Visualize: Power BI connects directly to the transformed tables in Snowflake. A dashboard provides interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) for business users.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Data Extraction: Python 3.9+ (pandas, snowflake-connector-python)

Data Warehouse: Snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è

BI & Visualization: Microsoft Power BI üìä

Data Export (Optional): MS Excel

‚ú® Features
